	<h2>The Idea</h2>
	
	<p class="lg">Web Landscape</p>

	<p>When we browse the web, we often find really weird stuff. Even among recent stuff, graphic choices, pure design, typography uses or just usability, are not always of the smartest.	We really don't want that every page looks like the next one. We like diversity.</p>

	<p class="lg">External Needs</p>

	<p>Every dealer may want to have his own identity on his website and other marketing material. This is especially true for dealers who distribute several brands. But sometimes, they could be interested in creating a dedicated website or a page where the proximity to the Manitou brand is clearly shown.</p>

	<p class="lg">Internal Needs</p>

	<p>As we needed a framework for all the tools we release, we thought it can be useful to open it to everyone who would need it (dealer, huge fan, extravagant blogger...). This is also why the framework is hosted on GitHub and that you, users of the Framework, can make pull requests in case something is: wrong, missing or buggy. All sorts of web applications are developed internally by other services. Quite often, we don't have a lot of time/budget to spend for customization. Moreover, it can make a real difference on users adoption.</p>
