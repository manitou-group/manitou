//The rules

//Obviously you need some kind of rules and criteria:

//1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
//2. Document all hacks fully:
	//What part of the codebase does it relate to?
	//Why was this needed?
	//How does this fix it?
	//How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
//4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
	//Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

/**
 * Example : Nav specificity fix.
 *
 * Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a {}`) which trumps the
 * nav selectors (`.site-nav a {}`). Use !important to override it until I
 * have time to refactor the header stuff.

		.site-nav a {
		    color: #BADA55 !important;
		}
